                        <h5>Phoenix Conservatory of Music</h5>
                        <li> -The Phoenix Conservatory of Music (PCM) is non-profit community music school that offers
                            classes to learn, create and perform music. PCM has recently started music classes at
                            Paradise community college, and is partnered with Grand Canyon University and Berklee
                            College of Music and The Berklee City Music Network in Boston Massachusetts.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li> -In middle school I learned how to read and play music starting with the clarinet.
                            continued my music education at PCM beginning with guitar and bass. I was actively involved
                            with PCM for over 4 years. I was accepted into the Berklee College of Music college prep
                            program where I learned how to practice and perform in music ensembles. I worked in groups
                            of students to generate music performances resulting in a variety of music genres. We
                            worked together several times a week to understand the theory of music, which is the
                            writing, reading and comprehension of music. We also learned audio production, which
                            included producing music using computer software to cleanup music and create new music. I
                            learned about the timing of music and how to listen by ear to create music, We performed in
                            several venues including the Nash, Salvation Center KROC Center, Desert Rose Steakhouse and
                            many others. I graduated from the program in 2018.</li>
